## 📖 Project Description

The **Django School Project Manager** is a web application built with Django that allows schools to efficiently manage students and classrooms. It demonstrates core Django functionalities including CRUD operations, user authentication, and the use of the Django admin panel.

Key features include:

- **Student Management:** Add, update, delete, and view student records. Each student is linked to a classroom for better organization.
- **Classroom Management:** Maintain classrooms with names and grades, enabling a clear structure for student assignments.
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and logout functionality using Django’s built-in forms. Only authenticated users can manage student data.
- **Admin Panel:** Django’s admin panel is configured to manage Students and Classrooms. Superuser access is required to utilize admin privileges.

This project is suitable for learning and demonstrating Django’s core features in a real-world scenario. It provides a clean separation between application logic, user interface, and administrative functionality, making it both educational and practical.
